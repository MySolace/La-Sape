# La Sape

La Sape is Crisis Text Line's live pattern library/style guide. It is built on top of a [SASS port](https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass) of [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html). The static files for displaying the pattern library are generated by [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator). They are hosted as a GitHub page here: [http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape](http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape). For etymology, look here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sape)

## Getting Started

Fabricator requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org), so make sure you have `v0.10` or higher installed before proceeding.

**Initializing the Submodule:**

Since we are bringing in the SASS port of Semantic UI as a submodule, you will have to do the following in the repo directory:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

After the initial initialization, you'll just need to run the update to keep the submodule up-to-date with the main repo.

**Start the local development environment:**

```
$ npm start
```

## Compiling to static HTML

1. When you are done making your changes, make sure to run the following, to compile the production version of the static HTML and asset files:

```
$ npm run build
```

2. Once the build script has finished, commit to a new branch and submit a PR.

Fabricator builds both a static documentation site and optimized CSS and JS toolkit files. Static files are compiled in the `dist` directory. You can view the files here: [http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape](http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape)
